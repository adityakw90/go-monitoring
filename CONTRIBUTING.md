## Coding Standards

### Go Style Guide

- Follow [Effective Go](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go) guidelines
- Use `gofmt` for formatting
- Follow the existing code style in the project

### Code Quality Requirements

- **Functions**: Keep functions under 25 lines when possible (max 30)
- **Parameters**: Maximum 4 parameters per function (5 requires refactoring)
- **Error Handling**: All errors must be handled explicitly
- **Comments**: Write self-documenting code; comments only when necessary
- **Tests**: Write tests for all exported functions

### Error Handling

- Always handle errors explicitly
- Use `fmt.Errorf` with `%w` verb for error wrapping
- Return sentinel errors for expected error conditions
- Document all error conditions in function comments

### Testing

- Write tests for all new functionality
- Maintain or improve test coverage (currently 97.6%)
- Use table-driven tests for multiple test cases
- Test both success and error paths
- Clean up resources in tests (use `defer` for shutdowns)

### Documentation

- Add GoDoc comments to all exported functions
- Include examples in documentation when helpful
- Update README.md for user-facing changes
- Update CHANGELOG.md for notable changes
